Created the project initially on 17.03.2022 22:00 +-
Worked on porject these days for aprox 17 hours, tried to use database from next courses but i think i missed something, that i will ask tomorrow.
Managed to make videoview working.
Failed for now to correctly display list of users.
Succesfully sent an user object to another activity via intents, got the firstname of the user and display it in the activity.



IDEA :

What i am planning to make maybe is not something that you can usually see, i was thinking about an app for friends or people in relationship or whatever, where they can communicate, watch videos together, do other activities , and feel each other presence using this app. I am really looking forward into making this app, though im not sure if it is enough for this course.


REQUIREMENTS:

1.As a user i want to be able to register, so i can have my own account;
2.As a user i want to be able to login, so i can have acces to my personal information, friends, and anything else related to my account.
3.As a user i want to be able to chat with my friends, so we can spend some time together in the app.
4.As a user i want to be able to watch videos, movies, anything with my friends, maybe even chat with them while watching.
5.As a user i want to have the abillity to vibrate my friends phone by clicking a button, so i can call them in the app this way, or just as a joke.
6.As a user i want to be able to see all my friends in a well ordinated list, and choose which one to call/invite.


** For now thats it, i am mostly sure i will get more ideas in future, i hope this will give an overview of the app**
